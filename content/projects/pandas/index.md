This project presents the design and simulation of an adjustable digital clock, developed as part of the learning outcomes from the Digital Electronics I course and lab. The project combines both theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired in the DLD course to design a functional digital timekeeping system capable of displaying and adjusting hours, minutes, and seconds.

The adjustable digital clock is designed using fundamental digital components such as binary counters, decoders, multiplexers, and seven-segment displays. A 1 Hz clock pulse generator serves as the timing source to increment the seconds counter, cascading through minutes and hours. Additional control circuitry allows the user to set or reset the time manually, making the system interactive and user-friendly.

The entire design was simulated using  Proteus before hardware implementation on a breadboard. This simulation stage helps verify timing accuracy, display functionality, and logical correctness, reducing errors in the physical setup.

This project not only demonstrates the practical application of DLD concepts but also reflects individual innovation and problem-solving skills. By integrating concepts from both course theory and lab practice, the project highlights how digital circuit design and simulation tools can be effectively used to develop a reliable, adjustable digital clock system.
